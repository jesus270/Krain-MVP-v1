        <p className="mb-4">
          Your participation in the Airdrop Program is voluntary and entirely at
          your own risk. You bear sole responsibility for obtaining appropriate
          legal, financial, tax, or other professional advice regarding your
          participation, including any implications of receiving or failing to

        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">

          1.4 Krain LLC may employ automated and manual methods, including
          geo-location and IP-address verification, to assess participants’
          eligibility. Participants may not use virtual private networks (VPNs),

          geographic restrictions. Attempts to bypass these controls may result
          in immediate disqualification.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          1.5 Krain LLC reserves the right to request additional information or
          documentation to verify compliance with anti-money laundering (AML)
          and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations or to ensure
          adherence to applicable laws. Participants agree to cooperate fully by
          providing accurate and truthful information. Failure to comply may
          result in disqualification or forfeiture of tokens.

        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To participate in the Krain Token Airdrop Program, you must meet the
          following requirements and agree to the associated conditions:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          2.1 You must own and provide an eligible digital wallet capable of
          receiving Krain Tokens. The wallet must support the blockchain network
          on which the Krain Tokens are issued. You are solely responsible for
          ensuring your wallet is correctly configured and secure, including
          safeguarding private keys, seed phrases, and any credentials required
          to access the wallet. Krain LLC will not assist in managing or
          recovering wallets or credentials.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          2.2 You must provide accurate, complete, and truthful information as
          part of your participation in the Airdrop Program. Providing false or
          incomplete information may result in disqualification or forfeiture of
          tokens.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          2.3 Claims for Krain Tokens must be submitted within the designated
          claim period (“Claim Submission Period”). Claims submitted after the
          Claim Submission Period will not be processed, and any unclaimed
          tokens may be forfeited at Krain LLC’s sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          2.4 You agree to follow all instructions and procedures established by
          Krain LLC for claiming and receiving Krain Tokens, including adherence
          to any technical or security protocols required during the claim
          process.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          2.5 Participation in the Airdrop Program does not require any
          purchase, payment, or transfer of consideration. Krain Tokens are
          distributed free of charge, except for any applicable gas fees or
          other third-party charges associated with blockchain transactions,
          which remain your responsibility. Failure to comply with the
          requirements in this section may result in exclusion from the Airdrop
          Program and revocation of any claimed tokens.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">3. Risks and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.1 Participation in the Krain Token Airdrop Program involves
          significant risks, including, but not limited to, technical issues,
          regulatory uncertainties, and potential financial loss. By
          participating, you acknowledge that you have independently assessed
          these risks and accept full responsibility for any consequences
          arising from your participation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.2 You are solely responsible for securing your digital wallet,
          including safeguarding private keys, seed phrases, and any credentials
          related to its access. Krain LLC has no control over or responsibility
          for the security of your digital wallet and will not replace or
          recover lost, stolen, or compromised tokens or wallet credentials.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.3 Blockchain technology is inherently subject to risks such as
          network failures, vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and
          susceptibility to malicious actions, including but not limited to
          hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and fraud. You acknowledge that
          these risks may impact your ability to claim, receive, or use Krain
          Tokens.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.4 Krain Tokens are distributed “as is” and “as available,” with no
          warranties or guarantees regarding their functionality, usability, or
          market value. Krain LLC disclaims all implied warranties, including,
          but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
          particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.5 Participation in the Airdrop Program does not create any fiduciary
          duty or advisory relationship between you and Krain LLC. All
          information provided by Krain LLC related to the Airdrop Program is
          for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal,
          financial, or tax advice.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.6 You are responsible for ensuring that your participation in the
          Airdrop Program complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and
          restrictions in your jurisdiction. Krain LLC is not liable for your
          failure to comply with such laws or regulations, including any
          economic or trade sanctions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.7 Krain LLC reserves the right to suspend, modify, or terminate the
          Airdrop Program at any time without prior notice. Krain LLC shall not
          be held liable for any loss, delay, or failure arising from events
          beyond its control, including but not limited to natural disasters,
          regulatory actions, or technical failures.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.8 By participating in the Airdrop Program, you expressly waive any
          claims against Krain LLC for losses or damages arising from your
          participation, including any inability to claim or use Krain Tokens or
          any loss of value associated with the tokens.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.9 Participants acknowledge that the value of Krain Tokens is highly
          volatile and may have no market value. Krain LLC provides no
          assurances regarding the future functionality, usability, or
          marketability of Krain Tokens.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.10 Participants are solely responsible for determining and complying
          with any tax liabilities associated with the receipt or holding of
          Krain Tokens in their jurisdiction. Krain LLC does not provide tax or
          legal advice and recommends consulting qualified professionals to
          understand the implications of participation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          3.11 The Krain Token and its associated blockchain network are part of
          an evolving technology landscape. Participants acknowledge that (a)
          Competing platforms or projects may diminish the value or utility of
          Krain Tokens, (b) Technological upgrades or network changes may
          introduce compatibility issues or vulnerabilities, (c) Smart contracts
          may contain errors, bugs, or security flaws that could lead to loss of
          tokens or functionality, (d) Decentralized governance, if applicable
          in the future, may lead to operational inefficiencies or risks.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          4.5 In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Krain Parties,
          arising out of or relating to your participation in the Airdrop
